## :mailbox: REST

### Files

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`openapi/types.rs` | Data types used for REST requests and replies.
`client-rest/src/lib.rs` | Imports the REST types file to create the `svc-telemetry-client-rest` library, usable by other Rust crates.
`client-grpc/src/grpc.rs` | Autogenerated GRPC client stubs usable by other Rust crates to easily communicate with the GRPC server of this service.

### Authentication

See the High-Level Services ICD.

### Endpoints

See the [Arrow API Documentation](https://www.arrowair.com/docs/category/apis) for specific request arguments.

| Endpoint | Type | Description |
| ---- | --- | ---- |
| `/health` | GET | 200 OK if all microservice dependencies are connected to this service.
| `/telemetry/aircraft/adsb` | POST | Report a packet conforming to [ADS-B protocol](https://airmetar.main.jp/radio/ADS-B%20Decoding%20Guide.pdf).
| `/telemetry/mavlink/adsb` | POST | Report a [Mavlink protocol](https://mavlink.io/en/guide/serialization.html) packet with an [ADS-B message payload](https://mavlink.io/en/messages/common.html#ADSB_VEHICLE).


## :speech_balloon: gRPC

### Files

These interfaces are defined in a protocol buffer file, [`grpc.proto`](../proto/grpc.proto).

### Integrated Authentication & Encryption

See Services ICD.

### GRPC Server Methods ("Services")

GRPC server methods are called "services", an unfortunate name clash with the broader concept of web services.

| Service | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `IsReady` | Returns a message indicating if this service is ready for requests.<br>Similar to a health check, if a server is not "ready" it could be considered dead by the client making the request.

### GRPC Client Messages ("Requests")

This service does not have any unique requests.
